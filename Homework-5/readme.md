## Group Events

### Project Summary

The website is primarily an online ordering system, following 3 different types such as a restaurant, amusement park, and an animal shelter. The user inputs their selected choices for whichever items are listed on the GUI by clicking add, this then would list whichever item selected and if needed to be removed would then click the remove button to eliminate it from the list.

### Key Takeaways

This project will teach us a multitude of things:
- css to stylize webpage
- use of DOM elements
- live links
- how to work as a group on github 


### Design Choices 

Designs choses are simple 
- (Sorry raccoon disciples I changed the color from #f5deb3 to darkkhaki)
Personally I just think it is better on the eyes but I don't want to make any changes because it does look like someone did make the effort to do that. There is nice boxes for the highlighted points on each page.
